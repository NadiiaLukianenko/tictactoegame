# TicTacToe Game

## Game Description:
- Tic-tac-toe (also known as Noughts and crosses or Xs and Os) is a game 
 for two players, X and O, who take turns marking the spaces in a 3Ã—3 grid. 
 The player who succeeds in placing three of their marks in a horizontal, 
 vertical, or diagonal row wins the game:
- Create new user, using the `create_user` endpoint
- Use `create_game` to create a game. Copy the `urlsafe_key` property for 
later use. Each game can be retrieved or played by using the path parameter 
`urlsafe_game_key`.
- X-Player starts game with the `make_move` endpoint by setting 
(i, j) - coordinates of marked space in grid.
- O-Player continues game with the `make_move` endpoint and selects free 
space in grid.
- After each move the proper vertical, horizontal and diagonal lines are 
evaluated and the `make_move` reply contains message either 'Game field is ...'
 or 'Game is over. Winner-..' or  or 'Game is over! Draw game!'
- For each player the quantity of wins, losses and draws are saved. The values
  can be retrieved by the `get_user_statistic` endpoint for all users or by the 
   `get_user_statistic` for specified user. They updated after game is over for 
  proper players. 
- The rating is calculated base on formula 2 * wins + draws - losses:
   2 points for each win, 1 point for each draw and -1 point for each loss.
