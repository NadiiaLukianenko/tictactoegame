Tic-Tac-Toe game

User model saves all data for user - name and e-mail.
And additionally, it saves statistical data for each user and calculates
rate and rank.
I added win, lose and draw



Rate is calculated according to the rule - 2 points for each win, 1 point
for each draw and -1 point for each loss.

Game model saves game data - who play (user_o, user_x), the date of
creation, the current state of game represented as one dimensional array.

History model saves a history of game moves in Json format:
{'Game state': <msg>, 'Player': <player>, 'Move': <i,j>}

UserForm, StatisticForm, RatingForm are used for data representation by
the user_to_form, statistic_to_form, rate_to_form methods.

After each move the field of game is updated and the current state of game is
validated with check_winner - the vertical, horizontal lines are validated.
And two diagonals if the latest cell is on diagonal.

Every monday on 19:00 the letter is sent to everyone who has active game.
